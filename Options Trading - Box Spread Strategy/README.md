# Options Trading - Box Spread Strategy

*Problem type:* Options pricing, strategy construction, and risk-return evaluation using real market data.

## General Context
This project focuses on the analysis of derivative strategies by implementing a box spread, a market-neutral options strategy designed to generate a fixed payoff with minimal risk. Using real options data, the study applies pricing models and market quotes to evaluate the payoff, Greeks, and sensitivity of the strategy under different market conditions. The project critically examines the extent to which the box spread can be considered risk-free and explores the range of possible outcomes.

## Project Overview
1. Select a stock or index with liquid options and define an expiration timeframe.
2. Construct a box spread using call and put options with real market quotes.
3. Price the options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model and compare with market data.
4. Save and process market data for reproducibility of results.
5. Report the payoff, profit, and return at expiration.
6. Calculate the “Greeks” (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) to measure sensitivities.
7. Analyze and discuss whether the strategy behaves as risk-free in practice, including responses to market changes.
8. Expand the analysis to investigate the range of possible returns, including best- and worst-case scenarios, across multiple option sets and maturities.
9. Summarize findings and critically assess the practical viability of the box spread as a risk management strategy.
