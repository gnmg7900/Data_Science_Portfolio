# Credit Risk Prediction and Customer Segmentation

*Problem type:* Supervised and unsupervised learning applied to credit risk assessment and customer profiling.


## General Context
This project addresses the challenge of predicting loan defaults and understanding customer behavior in consumer credit markets. Using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, the study applies data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict the probability of default at the loan application stage. In parallel, unsupervised learning techniques are used for customer segmentation, enabling lenders to design personalized loan products, improve risk management, and enhance customer satisfaction.


## Project Overview
1. Data Cleaning and Exploration
* Handle missing values, data type inconsistencies, and outliers.
* Convert raw data into features suitable for predictive modeling.
* Explore relationships between variables while avoiding data leakage.
2. Classification â€“ Predicting Loan Defaults
* Train classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks) to predict payment difficulties.
* Compare models using evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
* Optimize classifiers to identify borrowers at higher risk of default.
3. Customer Segmentation
* Apply unsupervised learning methods (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group customers based on financial behavior and risk profiles.
* Evaluate the best segmentation approach and interpret the customer clusters.
* Provide actionable insights by characterizing segments (e.g., high-risk vs. low-risk borrowers, financially stable vs. vulnerable customers).
