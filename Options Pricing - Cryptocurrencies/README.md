# Option Pricing - Cryptocurrencies

*Problem type:* Derivatives pricing and volatility estimation for cryptocurrency options using real market data.


## General Context
This project investigates the emerging field of cryptocurrency options, a relatively new but fast-growing area of financial derivatives. 

Using real options data collected from Deribit for assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Ripple, the study applies option pricing models and volatility estimation techniques to evaluate mispricing opportunities and hedging strategies. By comparing historical and implied volatility, the project aims to better understand the dynamics and risk characteristics of crypto derivatives markets.


## Project Overview
1. Collect put and call options data for a selected cryptocurrency (near-the-money, multiple maturities) and store for reproducibility.
2. Estimate volatility using different historical time series with varying lengths.
3. Calculate implied volatility across option maturities and compare it with historical volatility.
4. Explore the implied volatility surface and interpret what it reveals about the cryptocurrency market.
5. Design and evaluate hedging strategies using available options:
6. Insure downside risk on an existing portfolio while retaining upside exposure.
7. Achieve downside risk insurance more cheaply by giving up upside exposure.
8. Critically analyze findings, highlighting implications for pricing efficiency and hedging in cryptocurrency derivatives.
