# Alternative Portfolio Strategies - Risk-Adjusted Performance Analysis

*Problem type:* Portfolio optimization and evaluation of alternative investment strategies using risk-adjusted performance metrics.


## General Context
This project expands on the analysis of portfolio management by evaluating a set of alternative allocation strategies. Using the same dataset as in the main portfolio management study, the project applies optimization methods that account for downside risk, expected shortfall, drawdowns, and momentum. The strategies are critically assessed against traditional benchmarks by comparing risk-adjusted performance across different market conditions.

## Project Overview
1. Implement and backtest alternative portfolio strategies, including:
* Mean-Downside (Semivariance) Risk Portfolio
*Hierarchical Risk Parity Portfolio (HRP)
* Mean-CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) Portfolio
* Minimum CDaR (Conditional Drawdown at Risk) Portfolio
* Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) Portfolio
*Maximum Omega Ratio (MOR) Portfolio
* Tactical Dual Momentum Strategy
* Adaptive Asset Allocation (AAA) Strategy
* Other extensions as appropriate
2. Evaluate strategies using alternative risk-adjusted performance metrics:
* Returns
* Volatility
* Sharpe Ratio
* Sterling Ratio
* Maximum Drawdown
3. Critically discuss and compare results to highlight the trade-offs between return and risk across different allocation methods.
