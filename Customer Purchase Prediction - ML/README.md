# Customer Purchase Prediction - ML

*Problem type:* Machine Learning - Predictive Model 


## General Context 
Using an online store, TechScape sells products and services which will allow their customers to stay focused on the most important things and improve the balance with technology use in their lives, such as meditation kits, books, stress balls, ”dumb” phones, retreats, among others. Focused in increasing their sales, TechScape intends to analyze the online behavior of their customers and to predict which customers have a high probability of buying their products depending on their online actions.

The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question “Which customers are more likely to buy our products?” using the small quantity of data accessible from the customers data base that contains general information about the customers and their behaviour in the website from February 2020 till December 2020 (excluding April).


## Project Overview
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), including outlier treatment and feature engineering.
2. Feature selection with filter, embedded and wrapper methods.
3. Re-sampling techniques for imbalanced dataset.
4. Classification problem. Main algorithms used, amongst others, were tree algorithms, KNN, neural networks, SVM and ensemle methods. 
5. Models comparision trough F1 score and ROC curve.
