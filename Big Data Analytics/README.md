# Big Data Analytics - Spark


*Problem type:* Solve a problem set using pySpark on databricks 


## General Context 
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept, which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. Movie buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The analysis of social networks can be a computationally intensive task, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. It is also a challenging problem to devise a correct methodology to infer an informative social network structure. Here, we will analyze a social network of actors and actresses that co-participated in movies. We will do some simple descriptive analysis, and in the end try to relate an actor/actressâ€™s position in the social network with the success of the movies in which they participate.


## Project Overview
1. Data loading, exploration, visualization and transformation in Spark.
2. Use of PySpark RDD and PySpark SQL (Dataframes).
3. PageRank algorithm computed using GraphX.
4. Make predictions and an end-to-end pipeline with MLlib.
