# Credit Risk Modeling - Probability of Default

*Problem type:* Classification problem for predicting credit default using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.


## General Context
This project focuses on credit risk modeling, one of the most relevant applications in financial data science. 

Using a credit dataset, the goal is to estimate the probability of default by applying and comparing multiple modeling approaches. The project combines statistical techniques, traditional machine learning methods, and deep learning architectures to evaluate predictive power and provide insights into credit scoring and risk assessment.


## Project Overview
1. Perform a preliminary statistical analysis of the credit dataset.
2. Develop a logistic regression model to predict the probability of default.
3. Implement a machine learning model (e.g., decision trees, random forest, or gradient boosting) for credit default prediction.
4. Apply a deep learning model to estimate the probability of default.
5. Evaluate and compare models using predictive power and performance metrics.
6. Prepare a final report summarizing findings, methodology, and insights.
