# Chest X-Ray Classification with CNNs


*Problem type:* Classification problem using a deep learning model (CNN)


## General Context
Application of deep learning methods in the field of medical imaging. 

Chest x-rays are one of the most requested and used exams by healthcare professionals, to assess the presence of thoracic diseases, due to its low-cost and non-invasive nature. Deep learning can, therefore, be an important tool in this area not only by providing a second opinion as a way of validating diagnostic interpretation by humans but also as an attractive way to increase the productivity and efficiency in the interpretation
allowing clinicians to better manage their time and resources. Several studies comparing human and deep learning already point to equivalent performance of both in diagnostic performance.

The dataset used on this project was downloaded from Kaggle. A multi-label deep learning model with a single-label multiclass outcome has been created: normal status, viral pneumonia, or bacterial pneumonia.


## Project Overview
1. Explore different deep learning CNN architectures, with different parameters and topologies, and understand what are the tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency
2. Explore different properties of the system, namely, overfittting and generalization ability of the model 
3. Conclude if the different CNN models tested could be deployed in medical context
