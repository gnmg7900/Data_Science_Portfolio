# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Regression

*Problem type:* Supervised regression for real estate price prediction using structured data.


## General Context
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house prices using the Ames, Iowa dataset. The goal is to understand the factors influencing real estate prices and to evaluate whether machine learning can outperform traditional econometric approaches. Beyond predictive performance, the study emphasizes model interpretability, enabling insights into which features most strongly drive property values.


## Project Overview
1. Data Engineering
* Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling null values, categorical variables, and outliers.
* Identify unusual or atypical sales (e.g., foreclosures, partial sales) and justify treatment.
* Engineer features suitable for regression models, ensuring robustness against data leakage.
2. Prediction Modeling
* Train regression models (e.g., linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to predict house prices.
* Compare model performance using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
* Select the best-performing model and assess its generalization to new market data.
3. Model Interpretability & Insights
* Analyze feature importance to determine the most influential predictors of housing prices.
* Explore interactions between features to uncover relationships in the housing market.
* Provide management-level insights into how the model explains property values and where limitations may exist.
