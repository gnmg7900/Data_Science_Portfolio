# Algorithmic Trading - Backtesting and Strategy Optimization

*Problem type:* Development, backtesting, and evaluation of systematic trading strategies using financial market data.

## General Context
This project focuses on the design and evaluation of algorithmic trading strategies. 

The goal is to define clear trading rules, generate signals, and backtest the strategies over historical market data spanning more than five years. By applying performance measures, optimization techniques, and risk management analysis, the project aims to evaluate profitability, robustness, and practical applicability of the selected strategies in both in-sample and out-of-sample periods.

## Project Overview
1. Selection of a trading strategy and description of its rationale.
2. Retrieval of historical market data (over 5 years) for the chosen assets.
3. Implementation of trading rules to generate buy/sell signals with full order specifications (side, price, size, etc.).
4. Backtesting the strategy and evaluating at least three performance measures, including profitability and risk-adjusted metrics.
5. Strategy optimization with out-of-sample testing, describing the target variable used for optimization and justifying its choice.
6. Analysis of profit/loss (P&L) and risk measures for both backtest and out-of-sample periods, with a commentary on the results.
7. Implementation of a pairs trading strategy, including initial cointegration analysis, backtesting, and interpretation of assumptions and outcomes.
