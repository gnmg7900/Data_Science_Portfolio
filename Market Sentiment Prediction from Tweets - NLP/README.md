# Market Sentiment Prediction from Tweets - NLP

*Problem type:* Text classification problem using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict market sentiment.


## General Context
This project applies NLP techniques to predict financial market sentiment based on Twitter data. Each tweet is labeled as Bearish, Bullish, or Neutral, and the task is to build a classifier capable of mapping raw text into one of these categories. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to compare models and evaluate their ability to capture sentiment signals that may influence financial markets.


## Project Overview
1. Data Exploration – Perform exploratory analysis of the tweet corpus, using visualizations such as bar charts and word clouds to identify trends and contextual patterns.
2. Data Preprocessing – Apply and experiment with at least four preprocessing techniques (stop word removal, tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, regex filtering).
3. Feature Engineering – Implement feature extraction methods such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec to represent tweets numerically.
4. Model Development – Train and evaluate at least four machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP).
5. Model Evaluation – Compare models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
6. Extensions – Explore advanced embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec variations) or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) to enhance classification performance.
