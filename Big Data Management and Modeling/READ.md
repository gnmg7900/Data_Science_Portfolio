# Big Data Modelling and Management - MongoDB


*Problem type:* Solve a problem set using MongoDB


## General Context
A leading company in logistics has data spread accross different systems, but they've already managed to pull them all into a mongo dump file. This data file is an exact dump of the SQL data so includes all the same structure, the SQL tables become collections and the rows become documents. This means all the original SQL keys are included in the data. Currently, the costs to develop the necessary queries to collect data to answer questions asked by the different departments are too high. 

Management concluded it is the right time to revise and revamp the data architecture, in order to speed up operations. In that context, we were tasked to merge all the company data into a single and coherent Mongo database. It is expected that, with this solution, the company will have a better understanding of their business and that the different departments will be able to obtain efficiently the answers they need.


## Project Overview

2. Setup the database so that it is performs well for the queries provided.
