    "WWI data are spread accross different systems, but we've already managed to pull them all into a mongo dump file. This data file is an exact dump of the SQL data so includes all the same structure, the SQL tables become collections and the rows become documents. This means all the original SQL keys are included in the data.<br>\n",

    "The table above was created to assist in the database modelling creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we have answered all the queries with the collections provided inittialy. Then, for each query, the collections used were identified with a cross in the table above. As an example, we can see that the query 1a) has used the collections \"Cities\", \"StateProvinces\" and \"Suppliers\". We can conclude that out of the 27 collections provided, only 14 were necessary to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to the database modelling, the first principle we took into account was to create a simpler model as learnt during the theorical classes, meaning to say, larger documents and fewer collections. In addition, with an overall view of the collections used, we were also in the right position to start thinking about either embedding or referencing the collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have started by identifying the group of collections mostly used together. It entails the \"SupplierTransactions\", \"PaymentMethods\", \"Suppliers\" and \"SupplierCategories\", which have been embedded. All these collections have a relationship one to many.  One \"Payment Method\" and one \"Suppliers\" have many \"SupplierTransactions\". The one documents are very small, therefore have been embedded on the many side. Following with the joining chain, one \"SuppplierCategory\" have many \"Suppliers\", with the formers being embedded on the many side. Based on the relationships referred, we had initally a \"SupplierTransactions\" collection with 2438 documents and end up with a new collection called \"suppliertransactions_embed\", which has also the same number of documents and is identified in the table above with blue colour. This embedded document allows to answer four queries (3e, 4a and 4c) and is referenced together with other collections to answer the query 5c). \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the query 3d), we could not use the collection embedded previously. This one had only the \"StateProvinces\" that were linked on the \"Suppliers\" collection via the \"Cities\" one. Instead of \"Suppliers\", this query is related to the \"Customers\", which have their own \"Cities\" and \"StateProvinces\" linked to. One \"StateProvince\" has many cities and one \"City\" has many \"Customers\". Since the \"Cities\" is the biggest collection in terms of documents out of these three by far, we have decided to embed the other two collections on it. The embedded collection result has been named \"customers_cities_states\" and is identified in the table above with red colour. This one allows to answer the query 3d) and is referenced together with other collections to answer the queries ( 2d, 3b, 5b and 5c). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the collections \"Invoices\" and \"InvoiceLines\" have a big number of documents. They had to be joined to answer both the queries 2d) and 3c). Therefore, it is natural that we have decided to embed them, in order to avoid to repeat two join operations. One \"Invoice\" has many \"InvoiceLines\". We have decided to embed on the one side because both queries have to be queried on this side. We have named the collection embedded output as \"Invoices_invoicelines\" and is identified in the table above with green colour. This one allows to answer the query 3c) and is referenced together with other collections to answer the queries ( 2d and 5a). \n",
    "\n",
    "The queries that entail different collections with different colours are the ones that had to be referenced. The two queries fully referenced are the ( 1a and 2a). The hybrid queries, meaning to say, using simultaniously both embedding and referencing models are the ones already referred above, but are again presented here to ease the understanding of the table, which are (2d, 3b, 5a, 5b and 5c). \n",
    "\n",
    "All the queries with a white cross on the respective row mean that could be answered with a single native collection. The ones not underlined mean that neither had to be referenced or embedded. The ones underlined, since the relevant collection had to be embedded, mean that are answered with the new embedded collection created. "
